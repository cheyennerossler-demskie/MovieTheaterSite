## Meeting Notes
Met with Eric on Tuesday 2/3/26

## MY Suggestions for first tasks:
LOGIC based
3. Release Date parsing is still pretty rigid, can't do something like 'November 13 2018'
4. Need to fix insert logic. Thelma becomes "ma, The"
6. Batchinsert doesn't play nice without page refreshing (at least the styling of insert buttons is wrong)
18. Automatic table backups to prevent me from accidentally wiping out a field when doing a SQL update
22. Fix syncing with our remote file backup
FEATURE based
1. Ability to edit an entity
8. Clicking a movie should display the movie in a popup rather than take over the full display
POSTER based
2. Ability to re-download and re-shrink a Poster
5. Set a max height/width on all poster displays

## MY actual first tasks (organized):
